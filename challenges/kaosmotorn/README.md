# solution
- find out that lines 8 and 9 contain text output -> the flag
- find 5 cells which are not calculated by a formula
  - E2, J6, B7, D14, G14
- write a script which bruteforces all combinations of these five cells
  - values 0 to 9
- solution:
    - E2 = 8
    - J6 = 8
    - B7 = 2
    - D14 = 1
    - G14 = 5
- alternative:
  - get formulas for known flag letters (`he2023{`, `}`)
  - solve, e.g. using Z3 solver
